# Contributing

To be honest, this is just me experimenting with rust and git, and so, I'm pretty sure that there are better ways to do some parts of the code.

If you really want to contribute, feel free to fork the repository, but I think I'll keep pull requests to myself.

If you have suggestions on the other hand, I'm fully open to those.
